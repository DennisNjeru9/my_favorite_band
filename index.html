        <h2>Linkin Park</h2>
        <p>
            Linking Park is an American-based band that is known for fusing rock and rap music. The band of five artists is native to California. 
            Originally, Linkin Park was known as <strong>Xero or Hybrid Theory</strong>. The names came from their first two EPs, going by the same names. 
            The two EPs were released between 1996 and I999. 
        </p>

        <h2>Music Career</h2>
        <p>
            Linkin Park has been active in the music industry for close to three decades having started their journey in 1996. Their first biggest album
            was Hybrid Theory, which received the Diamond Certification, <em>a reward given to artists for albums that garner sales of more than 10 million copies.</em>
            To date the band has worked with two major music labels: <strong>Warner Bros</strong> & <strong>Machine Shop</strong>. The band specialises in four main genres, namely:
